title: Introduction to API authentication
---

In this module, we will explore the various authentication concerns in APIs and how they can be exploited. By the end, you will know how to secure APIs effectively and prevent similar attacks when you implement an API.

## Authentication

To integrate with different software or services, APIs will often define methods to share data and perform actions. For example, you might be familiar with delivery services. These services use APIs to share location data and estimated arrival times so you can stay updated. Because APIs often handle sensitive data, we expect only relevant parties can see our data.

It would be wrong if anyone can access each other's data. That is why at the core of any API is authentication. This is a process that verifies the identity of a user to ensure only authorized people can access the API. We need authentication to secure sensitive data and ensure privacy and data integrity.

## Authentication Methods

When it comes to authentication, there are several methods available, each with its own use cases. These methods provide the necessary security and verification to ensure only authorized users can interact with the API.

**Basic Authentication:** This is an older HTTP-based authentication scheme that lets users send their username and password as plain text in the HTTP request. This means it is easier to implement, but it is now considered outdated and insecure with most services requiring more secure methods.

**API Keys:** This is a simple and commonly used method, where a unique key is assigned to each user and must be included in each API request. This ensures that the user is identified and authorized to access the API, but these keys can be hard to manage and distribute in large environments.

**JSON Web Tokens:** This is a stateless and compact method to authenticate users. JWTs encode user credentials into a token, which is then sent with each API request. This means the server does not need to store session information, which makes JWTs a scalable solution to authenticate users.

**OAuth:** This is a more advanced and secure protocol that allows users to grant third-party services access to their resources without sharing their actual credentials. It provides a safe and convenient way for users to log in to services using their existing social media accounts or other platforms.

Each method has its own uses cases. To decide which method is best, we have to think about the security requirements, user experience, and scalability. For example, API keys are secure but it could be awkward for everyday use on a social media platform. But with proper authentication, we can secure sensitive data and maintain the integrity of the API.
