## Topics

This module introduces the critical concepts of API authentication, focusing on the importance of securing sensitive data and verifying user identities. It covers:

- Key authentication methods such as Basic Authentication, API Keys, JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), and OAuth.

- Strengths and limitations of different approaches.

- Factors to consider when selecting an authentication method, including security, scalability, and user experience.

## Real Examples

Two real-world case studies are presented to highlight authentication vulnerabilities and their implications:

- **Kaiten:** A rate-limiting bypass vulnerability was exploited using the `X-Forwarded-For header`, enabling brute-force attacks to guess PINs.

- **AWS IAM:** A timing-based username enumeration flaw revealed valid usernames due to response-time differences in the authentication flow.

Both examples illustrate common weaknesses in API authentication and provide practical solutions to mitigate risks.

## Practice

The practice section includes hands-on exercises to simulate and understand authentication vulnerabilities:

- **Obtain a Valid JWT:** Analyze a legitimate JWT to understand its structure and the data it contains.

- **Forge a JWT:** Experiment with creating a forged JWT to bypass authentication mechanisms and access restricted endpoints.

These exercises offer practical experience in identifying and addressing authentication vulnerabilities in API implementations.
